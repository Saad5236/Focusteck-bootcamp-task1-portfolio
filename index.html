                  <div>
                    <p>I've successfully developed a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. This project has been a rich learning experience, particularly in advancing my JavaScript skills.</p>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I've also learned the qualities of a committed and persevering programmer. This project demanded dedication as I delved into complex logic using Javascript, and I remained persistent even when faced with challenges. It's also taught me the importance of adaptability, as I learned to accept different and unique solutions by seeking out ideas that I've gained from various platforms like Youtube and Stack Overflow. Through this project, I've not only created a fun game but also cultivated the essential attributes of a skilled programmer.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p>This a desktop application designed specifically for a general store to streamline daily operations. As a shopkeeper, I understand the complexities involved in managing inventory, transactions and other operations, so I embarked on creating a solution.</p>
                    <p>This software is made in Java language, using Java-FX library which is specifically used for creating client-side desktop applications. As for storing data, MySQL database was integrated with this application.</p>
                    <p>This project was made by me and my university friend. And together we learned a key lesson to work as a team. My university friend and I collaborated effectively, addressing challenges, sharing ideas, and establishing a smooth workflow. And for daily report, we used to do daily meetings.</p>
